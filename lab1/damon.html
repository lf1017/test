			<p>Hello Everyone! Thank you for visiting my page, my name is Damon Jackson. I am 41 and I am married, with a very large family, 4 children that live with my wife and I, and 2 children from my previous marriage. I have been a firefighter and a paramedic for many years and while the work is fulfilling, I have to spend long hours away from my family. I have returned to school to unlock the absolute best version of myself for my family. I believe that by learning to code, learning the right questions to ask, and by thinking more analytically: I can have a strong impact in my field, while spending more quality time with my family.
			</p>
